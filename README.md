## Projects

- The **majority** of my projects remain **private** as they often pertain to my previous ventures in youth entrepreneurship, ongoing light entrepreneurship endeavors, or other ventures that I prefer to keep **confidential**.

* **[KeyAuth Telegram Bot](https://github.com/mazkdevf/keyauth-telegram-bot/)**, an KeyAuth open-source authentication Telegram Bot for communicating with Seller API (Generating licenses, managing subscriptions) etc. (NON OFFICIAL, BUT DEV TEAM MEMBER MADE)

* Introducing **[KeyAuth-JS-Example](https://github.com/mazkdevf/KeyAuth-JS-Example)**, an KeyAuth open-source authentication SDK for JavaScript specifically designed for seamless installation, maintenance, and execution. 

* I'm proud to introduce **[EducationGit](https://github.com/mazkdevf/EducationGit)**, a JavaScript class meticulously designed to empower developers with seamless access to the extensive benefits offered by the esteemed GitHub Education pack.

* I serve as a Volunteer Free Will Manager for KeyAuth, where I actively assist the owner in various tasks related to administration, bot management, and backend development. After a discussion with the owner, we agreed that instead of financial compensation, I would receive links on the KeyAuth website to promote my own sites, thereby mutually benefiting both parties.


## Good Links!
- **[Cyclic](https://app.cyclic.sh/#/join/mazkdevf)** - The free plan is great for prototyping new ideas, coming up with wild experiments, hosting personal projects, doing homework or building stuff for school. Best of all, it's free for a lifetime.
